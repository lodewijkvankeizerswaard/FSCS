# FACT

## Datasets
The evalutation is done on four different datasets: [Adult](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html), [Civil Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification/data) and [CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/). This section describes how to obtain each of the datasets.

### Adult
The Adult dataset can be downloaded for free, without any registration using the [Adult dataset link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), or by running the `data/get_adult.sh` (Linux and Mac only).

### CelebA
The [CelebA dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) is available for download through [Pytorch torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#celeba), and thus does not need to be downloaded seperately.
